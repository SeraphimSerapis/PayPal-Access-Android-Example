What is PayPal Access?
----------------------
PayPal Access is a solution for identifying users with their PayPal account. It's implementation can be done via OpenID or OAuth2. This app uses OAuth2 because of the low client-side overhead.

With using Access people are able to use their existing account instead of being forced to create new credentials and having to remember another password.

All settings for Access (*Which data do you need in your client?*) can be done in PayPal's developer console:
